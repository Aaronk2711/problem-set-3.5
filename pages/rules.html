<h3>Sparring</h3>
<p>There are many variations on the competitions you can compete in in Taekwondo.
  The one that is used at the Olympics is the most common(and practical one), sparring.
  Sparring using the Olympic rules entails two opponents facing off in an enclosed ring.
  As you can see in the picture above, the ring is surrounded by coaches on all four corners
  and each of 3 rounds is 2 minutes long. By the end of the match, whoever has more points
  wins the match. To earn points, you must make contact with the opponent's strike zones(including
  the head, chest, stomach, and back). A regular hit to the body is worth 1 point. A hit that involves
  a spin is worth 3 points if it connects. A regular hit to the head is worth 3 points, and a spinning
  kick to the head is worth 4.</p>

  <p>However, if you happen to fall down in the middle of the match, then you lose any points that
    you might have earned from the kick you just performed. In addition, if you perform a serious
    offence (including but not limited to) throwing an oppponent, stepping out of the ring on purpose,
    hitting the face with something other than a foot, or hitting bellow the belt you may be issued a
    'Gaem-jeom' by the referee. This means that you have lost 1 point and receive a warning. If the match
    ends with both competitors equal for points, then the match usually goes into 'sudden death' with
    the person who scores the first point winning. In addition, although very rare, if one person
    is ahead of the other by 12 points or more, the match is immediately ended because it is believed
    that it is impossible to come back from. </p>


    <h3>Form</h3>

    <p>Another variation on Taekwondo competition is forms. This type of competition has people competing
      with the score card rather than trying to score more points on each other. The individual must
      complete a series of moves(which in this case, is the form) in the best manner possible. This involves
      having more power, technique and overall better form than the other. This manner of competition is much
      more subjective and is part of the reason that it is not in Olympics but rather, in more local competitions.
      There are three judges in this event who, in many cases, give a score from 0 - 10. Then, the scores of the
      three judges is added up for a total score out of 30. Whichever individual receives the most points from
      judges is crowned the victor. </p>

    <h3>Breaking</h3>
    <p>The final common variation of Taekwondo competitions is breaking. This means that people will compete to see
      who can break a certain amount of wooden bords with certain strikes the best. This is probably the most subjective
      out of all of these three competitions and is thus the least common found in competition. In addition to just
      good technique, to have a better chance of winning, the person should have good show. This means yelling louder and
      having a better stance and energy before and after the strike. Similar to forms, there are three judges who can score
      out of 10 points for a total score out of 30 points. Whichever person receives the most points from the three judges
      is crowned the victor. </p>

      <h3>Performance Teams</h3>
      <p>Although not technically an official type of competition(according to the World Taekwondo Federation and US Taekwondo
      Organization), this type of performance is very often judged and scored against other teams to determine a winner.
      Basically, teams of a certain size will work together to create a performance that includes forms, breaking, and whatever
      the team wants. It is much more open to interpretation and again, even more subjective than breaking. In addition to having
      the most technical performance, making the audience laugh, telling a story, or even adding some extra danger to the performance
      helps the team tremendously. Each one of these events are scored differently so it is extemely difficult to give a blanket
      explanation of the scoring format. </p>
