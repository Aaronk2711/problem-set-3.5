    <p>Taekwondo is a very exciting sport to watch and participate in. The purpose of this website is to
    inform you about Taekwondo in general. It originates from South Korea, centuries
    ago, and is now one of the biggest martial arts on the face of the planet. Taekwondo teaches how to maintain both physical
    and mental health. In recent years, Taekwondo has come under the public eye. First, in 2000, the Sydney
    Olympics introduced Taekwondo to the olympics. Ever since, Taekwondo has been growing faster than ever.</p>

    <p> To show rank in Taekwondo, students and teachers alike are given belts. Each belt has a different color
      which represents the rank of the individual. Students usually start off with a white belt or even no belt
      at all. Then, over the course of a few years, the student will earn the following belts:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>White Belt</li>
      <li>Yellow Belt</li>
      <li>Green Belt</li>
      <li>Blue Belt</li>
      <li>Purple Belt</li>
      <li>Brown Belt</li>
      <li>Black Belt(1st Degree through 9th Degree)</li>

      <p> Although not every Taekwondo school uses the same belt system, they generally follow this
      similar pattern. All these belts lead up to a black belt, which is what every Taekwondo student's ultimate
      goal is. Once receiving a black belt, individuals can choose to go further to pursue a higher degree of
      black belt. The first one they receive is 1st degree black belt. Over time, the individual will work their
      way up to a 9th degree black belt. This degree of black belt takes decades of training to achieve and only
      a slight few have ever achieved such a feat. </p>

      to Taekwondo. </p>
