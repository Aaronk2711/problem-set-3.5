<p>Through years of training, Taekwondo practioners obtain the ability
  to perform maginficent feats of skill and strength. However, they would
  not be able to perform these actions without first learning the core
  principles and basic moves that lay the foundation for Taekwondo. You can
  see the basic moves above. The first column, kicks, are slower more powerful,
  strikes. They can do a lot of damage, but they also need to be set up with punches.
  Punches(and strikes with your hand in general) are meant to create openings for your
  kicks to come in. Blocks are good ways of protecting yourself from you opponent's
  attacks in case you can not just dodge the strike. Finally, the mental aspect of
  Taekwondo has and equal, if not greater value to a practioner than the physical
  part. This is because, without a balanced mind, you will not be able to control yourself
  in times when self-control is necessary. </p>

  <p>All of these skills come with great responsibility, however. Taekwondo is only meant
    to be used in self-defense. It should not be used to initiate a fight. This is where
    the mental aspect of Taekwondo comes into play. You must learn to control yourself
    in times when it is required to keep calm and not initiate a fight. All in all, Taekwondo
    is a great martial art to learn if you are looking to improve your mental and physical health
    as well as physical endurance.</p>
